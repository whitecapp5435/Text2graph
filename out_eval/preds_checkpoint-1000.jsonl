{"idx": 8376, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nIn patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion regimen, if performed by experienced operators in a timely manner. Nevertheless, myocardial damage is not immediately terminated after successful epicardial reperfusion by primary PCI. Current strategies are directed to improve myocardial tissue perfusion, which is impaired in approximately 50% of patients and which has prognostic impact. Adjunctive intravenous abciximab administration is an established therapy to improve coronary microcirculation and reduce major cardiac adverse events.5-10 In randomized clinical trials intravenous abciximab administration has been studied. Clinical trials have shown that earlier administration results in higher preinterventional TIMI-flow with subsequent improved perfusion post PCI. However, in a pooled analysis there was no effect on mortality. As door-to-balloon-times getting shorter in current trials, earlier abciximab administration requires treatment in the prehospital setting, which poses substantial logistic obstacles. Another option might be intracoronary abciximab bolus administration which results in very high local platelet inhibitor concentrations. This might be favorable in dissolution of thrombi and microemboli with subsequent improved myocardial microcirculation, reduction of no-reflow, and infarct size. Currently, there is only limited clinical experience on the efficacy of intracoronary abciximab administration mainly restricted to case reports, retrospective registries or small randomized trials. In a recently published randomized clinical trial, we were able to show that intracoronary versus intravenous abciximab bolus administration has beneficial effects on the occurrence of no-reflow and infarct size assessed by contrast-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging. This led to a trend towards improved clinical outcome. The composite major adverse cardiac event rate, defined as death, reinfarction, target vessel revascularization, and new congestive heart failure, at 30 day follow-up was 15.6% after intravenous and 5.2% after intracoronary abciximab administration (relative risk 3.00; 95% confidence intervals 0.94-10.80; p=0.06).\n\nCurrently, there is no adequately powered clinical trial to assess the effects of intracoronary bolus in comparison to standard intravenous abciximab administration. Due to its general availability and its ease of intracoronary administration this treatment has overwhelming potential in clinical practice, which is much easier to achieve than a logistically cumbersome prehospital or interhospital transfer administration.\n\nIn the era of evidence-based medicine, such a trial is of paramount importance to achieve a break-through in abciximab use and a reduction of the high associated morbidity and mortality of STEMI patients.", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0, \"text\": \"acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\", \"type\":

{"idx": 2993, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nThe present study aimed to apply a sinusoidal model to duck body weight records in order to introduce it to the field of poultry science. Using 8 traditional growth functions as a guide (Bridges, Janoschek, logistic, Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy, Richards, Schumacher, and Morgan), this study looked at how well the sinusoidal equation described the growth patterns of ducks. By evaluating statistical performance and examining model behavior during nonlinear regression curve fitting, models were compared. The data used in this study came from 3 published articles reporting 1) body weight records of Kuzi ducks aged 1 to 70 d, 2) body weight records for Polish Peking ducks aged 1 to 70 d, and 3) average body weight of Peking ducks aged 1 to 42 d belonging to 5 different breeds. The general goodness-of-fit of each model to the various data profiles was assessed using the adjusted coefficient of determination, root mean square error, Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion. All of the models had adjusted coefficient of determination values that were generally high, indicating that the models generally fit the data well. Duck growth dynamics are accurately described by the chosen sinusoidal equation. The sinusoidal equation was found to be one of the best functions for describing the age-related changes in body weight in ducks when the growth functions were compared using the goodness-of-fit criteria. To date, no research has been conducted on the use of sinusoidal equations to describe duck growth development. To describe the growth curves for a variety of duck strains/lines, the sinusoidal function employed in this study serves as a suitable substitute for conventional growth functions.", "gold_text":

Except, if you look at the images, it seems pretty clear that they've got nothing, whatsoever, to do with Wolverine. In other words, 20th Century Fox appears to have broken the law, in claiming it held the copyright over the figures in those images, when it appears it did not. Unfortunately, the site hosting his content doesn't fully understand that under the DMCA it can re-enable his content if he files a counternotice and 20th Century Fox fails to file a lawsuit within a specified period of time. Instead, it's told the blogger that he needs to get the lawyer from 20th Century Fox to agree that the content doesn't infringe -- and the lawyers don't seem to be responding to any emails, meaning

The aim of CPMT is to improve parental skills, to enable parents promoting the following seven target skills in their child: socio-emotional engagement, emotional regulation, imitation, communication, joint attention, play and cognitive flexibility and cooperative interaction. An individualized treatment plan is designed for each child in order to determine his developmental level and treatment goals (Valeri et al., 2019).", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0,
