{"idx": 8376, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nIn patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion regimen, if performed by experienced operators in a timely manner. Nevertheless, myocardial damage is not immediately terminated after successful epicardial reperfusion by primary PCI. Current strategies are directed to improve myocardial tissue perfusion, which is impaired in approximately 50% of patients and which has prognostic impact. Adjunctive intravenous abciximab administration is an established therapy to improve coronary microcirculation and reduce major cardiac adverse events.5-10 In randomized clinical trials intravenous abciximab administration has been studied. Clinical trials have shown that earlier administration results in higher preinterventional TIMI-flow with subsequent improved perfusion post PCI. However, in a pooled analysis there was no effect on mortality. As door-to-balloon-times getting shorter in current trials, earlier abciximab administration requires treatment in the prehospital setting, which poses substantial logistic obstacles. Another option might be intracoronary abciximab bolus administration which results in very high local platelet inhibitor concentrations. This might be favorable in dissolution of thrombi and microemboli with subsequent improved myocardial microcirculation, reduction of no-reflow, and infarct size. Currently, there is only limited clinical experience on the efficacy of intracoronary abciximab administration mainly restricted to case reports, retrospective registries or small randomized trials. In a recently published randomized clinical trial, we were able to show that intracoronary versus intravenous abciximab bolus administration has beneficial effects on the occurrence of no-reflow and infarct size assessed by contrast-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging. This led to a trend towards improved clinical outcome. The composite major adverse cardiac event rate, defined as death, reinfarction, target vessel revascularization, and new congestive heart failure, at 30 day follow-up was 15.6% after intravenous and 5.2% after intracoronary abciximab administration (relative risk 3.00; 95% confidence intervals 0.94-10.80; p=0.06).\n\nCurrently, there is no adequately powered clinical trial to assess the effects of intracoronary bolus in comparison to standard intravenous abciximab administration. Due to its general availability and its ease of intracoronary administration this treatment has overwhelming potential in clinical practice, which is much easier to achieve than a logistically cumbersome prehospital or interhospital transfer administration.\n\nIn the era of evidence-based medicine, such a trial is of paramount importance to achieve a break-through in abciximab use and a reduction of the high associated morbidity and mortality of STEMI patients.", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0, \"text\": \"acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\", \"type\":

{"idx": 2993, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nThe present study aimed to apply a sinusoidal model to duck body weight records in order to introduce it to the field of poultry science. Using 8 traditional growth functions as a guide (Bridges, Janoschek, logistic, Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy, Richards, Schumacher, and Morgan), this study looked at how well the sinusoidal equation described the growth patterns of ducks. By evaluating statistical performance and examining model behavior during nonlinear regression curve fitting, models were compared. The data used in this study came from 3 published articles reporting 1) body weight records of Kuzi ducks aged 1 to 70 d, 2) body weight records for Polish Peking ducks aged 1 to 70 d, and 3) average body weight of Peking ducks aged 1 to 42 d belonging to 5 different breeds. The general goodness-of-fit of each model to the various data profiles was assessed using the adjusted coefficient of determination, root mean square error, Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion. All of the models had adjusted coefficient of determination values that were generally high, indicating that the models generally fit the data well. Duck growth dynamics are accurately described by the chosen sinusoidal equation. The sinusoidal equation was found to be one of the best functions for describing the age-related changes in body weight in ducks when the growth functions were compared using the goodness-of-fit criteria. To date, no research has been conducted on the use of sinusoidal equations to describe duck growth development. To describe the growth curves for a variety of duck strains/lines, the sinusoidal function employed in this study serves as a suitable substitute for conventional growth functions.", "gold_text":

Unfortunately, the site hosting his content doesn't fully understand that under the DMCA it can re-enable his content if he files a counternotice and 20th Century Fox fails to file a lawsuit within a specified period of time. Instead, it's told the blogger that he needs to get the lawyer from 20th Century Fox to agree that the content doesn't infringe -- and the lawyers don't seem to be responding to any emails, meaning

{"idx": 11322, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nSeveral years ago I wrote an article titled “Impertinent remarks: when critical comments lead to litigation.” The article described how health care professionals can inadvertently incite patients to file lawsuits simply by making comments such as “I would hardly expect that kind of complication from such a simple procedure” or “the radiologist would have caught that lump if he had looked for it.” These innocent remarks may lead patients to believe there was something wrong with their previous treatment. Then the lawyers get involved.\nSince writing that article, I have made it a point to study the “impertinent remarks” that I hear others make. My intent is not to sue anyone, but to further understand what leads seemingly smart, rational people to say the most absurd things during conversations.\nOf course, I am guilty of this as well. Once I complimented a co-worker on her new hairstyle and five minutes later I remembered she was undergoing treatment for cancer. Her new “hairstyle” was actually a wig.\nI seem to make impertinent remarks in response to the awkwardness of the situation. I need to fill the silences in conversation with something. It’s taken me years to learn the value of conversational silences . . . they are the perfect opportunity to let the other guy talk or to politely transition out of the conversation.\nHence, I introduce this blog. I promise not to make it a showcase for impertinent remarks. I will keep my posts short and to the point, and only write when I have something worth writing about. No writing for the sake of writing or because I haven’t posted for a while.\nAnd since this is a blog — if I don’t live up to this promise — you can call me on it.", "gold_text": "{\"entities\":

An Excerpt from Who Was Martin Luther King, Jr.?\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was only 25 when he helped organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott and was soon organizing black people across the country in support of the right to vote, desegregation, and other basic civil rights. Maintaining nonviolent and peaceful tactics even when his life was threatened, King was also an advocate for the poor and spoke out against racial and economic injustice until his death—from an assassin’s bullet—in 1968. With clearly written text that explains this tumultuous time in history and 80 black-and-white illustrations, this Who Was…? celebrates the vision and the legacy of a remarkable man.\nTo keep up-to-date, input your email address, and we will contact you on publication\nPlease alert me via email when:", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0, \"text\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"type\": \"Person\"}, {\"id\": 1, \"text\": \"Montgomery Bus Boycott\", \"type\": \"Event\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"text\": \"black people\", \"type\": \"Group\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"text\": \"right to vote\", \"type\": \"Right\"}, {\"id\": 4, \"text\": \"desegregation\", \"type\": \"Right\"}, {\"id\": 5, \"text\": \"basic civil rights\", \"type\": \"Rights\"}, {\"id\": 6, \"text\": \"nonviolent and peaceful tactics\", \"type\": \"Tactics\"}, {\"id\": 7, \"text\": \"assassin\\u2019s bullet\", \"type\": \"Cause of death\"}, {\"id\": 8, \"text\": \"1968\", \"type\": \"Year\"}], \"relations\": [{\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"Montgomery Bus Boycott\", \"type\": \"involved in\"}, {\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"black people\", \"type\": \"organized\"}, {\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"right to vote\", \"type\": \"advocated for\"}, {\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"desegregation\", \"type\": \"advocated for\"}, {\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"basic civil rights\", \"type\": \"advocated for\"}, {\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"nonviolent and peaceful tactics\", \"type\": \"practiced\"}, {\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"assassin\\u2019s bullet\", \"type\": \"died from\"}, {\"head\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"tail\": \"1968\", \"type\": \"lived until\"}]}", "pred_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0, \"text\": \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\", \"type\": \"Person\"}, {\"id\": 1, \"text\": \"ISBN 9780448478050\", \"type\": \"ISBN\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"text\": \"112 pages\", \"type\": \"Physical characteristics\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"text\": \"27 Dec 2007\", \"type\": \"Publication date\"}, {\"id\": 4, \"text\": \"Grosset & Dunlap\", \"type\": \"Publisher\"}, {\"id\": 5, \"text\": \"5.59 x 7.67in\", \"type\": \"Dimensions\"}, {\"id\": 6, \"text\": \"8 -

If you are going to be spending time in the sun this summer – regardless of whether this will be by the pool, at a sporting event, on the golf course, or somewhere else – here are things to make sure you keep in mind in order to avoid heat exposure.Heat exposure can occur in temperatures ranging from 80 degrees and higher, so even when it does not feel oppressively hot, you need to be aware of the risk, and the best way of all to chase away heat exposure is by drinking lots of water. When your body sweats, it needs to be replenished, and if you are not replenishing the water in your body you will end up feeling dizzy, dehydrated, and sick – so keep water with you when you are outdoors, and drink plenty of it! You also need to make sure you dress for practicality over looks; not to say that you cannot look good when you are outside, but remember that fewer layers will keep you from overheating, and lighter colors will keep you cooler than darker colors will, as they do not absorb the sun nearly as much. And if you start to experience a pale appearance, dizziness, tiredness, lightheadedness, nausea, or any of the other symptoms of heat exposure, you should take immediate action; get out of the sun right away, and hydrate slowly while staying on your feet. Summer can be plenty of fun, and the heat can even be fun, as long as you are not subjecting yourself to risk; follow these tips, and you can avoid heat exposure while still enjoying the heat!",

{"idx": 8302, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nMicrobial species capable of co-existing with healthy individuals, such as the commensal fungus Candida albicans, exploit multifarious strategies to evade our immune defenses. These strategies include the masking of immunoinflammatory pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at their cell surface. We reported previously that C. albicans actively reduces the exposure of the proinflammatory PAMP, β-1,3-glucan, at its cell surface in response to host-related signals such as lactate and hypoxia. Here, we show that clinical isolates of C. albicans display phenotypic variability with respect to their lactate- and hypoxia-induced β-1,3-glucan masking. We have exploited this variability to identify responsive and non-responsive clinical isolates. We then performed RNA sequencing on these isolates to reveal genes whose expression patterns suggested potential association with lactate- or hypoxia-induced β-1,3-glucan masking. The deletion of two such genes attenuated masking: PHO84 and NCE103. We examined NCE103-related signaling further because NCE103 has been shown previously to encode carbonic anhydrase, which promotes adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling at low CO2 levels. We show that while CO2 does not trigger β-1,3-glucan masking in C. albicans, the Sch9-Rca1-Nce103 signaling module strongly influences β-1,3-glucan exposure in response to hypoxia and lactate. In addition to identifying a new regulatory module that controls PAMP exposure in C. albicans, our data imply that this module is important for PKA signaling in response to environmental inputs other than CO2.IMPORTANCEOur innate immune defenses have evolved to protect us against microbial infection in part via receptor-mediated detection of \"pathogen-associated molecular patterns\" (PAMPs) expressed by invading microbes, which then triggers their immune clearance. Despite this surveillance, many microbial species are able to colonize healthy, immune-competent individuals, without causing infection. To do so, these microbes must evade immunity. The commensal fungus Candida albicans exploits a variety of strategies to evade immunity, one of which involves reducing the exposure of a proinflammatory PAMP (β-1,3-glucan) at its cell surface. Most of the β-1,3-glucan is located in the inner layer of the C. albicans cell wall, hidden by an outer layer of mannan fibrils. Nevertheless, some β-1,3-glucan can become exposed at the fungal cell surface. However, in response to certain specific host signals, such as lactate or hypoxia, C. albicans activates an anticipatory protective response that decreases β-1,3-glucan exposure, thereby reducing the susceptibility of the fungus to impending innate immune attack. Here, we exploited the natural phenotypic variability of C. albicans clinical isolates to identify strains that do not display the response to β-1,3-glucan masking signals observed for the reference isolate, SC5314. Then, using genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we compared these non-responsive isolates with responsive controls to identify genes potentially involved in β-1,3-glucan masking. Mutational analysis of these genes revealed that a sensing module that was previously associated with CO2 sensing also modulates β-1,3-glucan exposure in response to hypoxia and lactate in this major fungal pathogen of humans.", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0, \"text\": \"Microbial species\", \"type\": \"Entity\"}, {\"id\": 1, \"text\": \"Candida albicans\", \"type\": \"Microbial

{"idx": 2622, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nA widely-viewed YouTube of Peter Schiff, the president of brokerage firm Euro Pacific Capital, has been making noise this week. Schiff had been predicting the real estate meltdown and credit crunch in the U.S. since 2006, long before anyone else understood the problems that were threatening the U.S. economy.\nSchiff was finally vindicated when a YouTube of his multiple TV appearance on CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg TV and other major U.S. networks, started gaining in popularity this week. In it, Schiff is seen debating with so-called experts, including Arthur Laffer of Laffer Investments, who were bullish on the stock market and the economy.\nTrouble is, these \"experts\" didn't have the understanding of economics that Schiff\nhas. The bearish Schiff was right on most of his predictions, including the housing meltdown, the liquidity problem and the recession (which he said would actually be a depression). And he had the guts to go on national TV to debate with arrogant analysts who belittlingly dismissed his arguments without even trying to understand what he was explaining.\nSo, what is Schiff predicting will happen next? He sees Asia as the next place for growth and says the Asian market will experience a tremendous boom. While this shouldn't come as a shocker, his reasons may surprise some. Schiff says that Asia's strong manufacturing sector and its ability to produce goods is its major strength. Schiff also sees the U.S. dollar, which has been gaining against 15 major currencies in the last few months, become weaker again and \"fall like a stone.\" The Chinese Yuan is the only currency that has been gaining against the dollar as of late.\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/claim/cjejms2tuq\" rel=\"me\">Technorati Profile</a>", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0, \"text\": \"Peter

Our results did not identify any genome-wide significant variants although, we found that a higher polygenic score (PGS) for antidepressant response in MDD was associated with higher odds of TEM in BD.

{"idx": 2213, "user": "Analyze this text, identify the entities, and extract meaningful relationships as per given instructions:\nBACKGROUND: The Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB) is a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) designed to measure the extent of interference, or difficulty, experienced by adults with communication disorders participating in their day-to-day communication activities. To date, there is limited evidence regarding sensitivity of the CPIB for capturing change with intervention in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD).\nAIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine the following measurement properties of the CPIB in PwPD who received community-based, standard care, speech-language therapy focusing on motor speech concerns: Change over time between treatment and observation groups, comparison to patient-defined ideal and satisfactory targets, comparison of static short form to computerised adaptive testing (CAT), comparison of self to proxy-rated scores, and comparison to other common PROMs.\nMETHODS AND PROCEDURES: Forty-six PwPD (20 treatment/26 observation) completed data collection upon enrolment (pre-treatment) and 6 months later. In addition to the CPIB, PROMs included the Voice Handicap Index 10-item short form (VHI-10), PROMIS Global Health-Related Quality of Life, Levels of Speech Usage, self-rated speech severity, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Participants also engaged in qualitative interviews. Forty-four family members completed proxy CPIB ratings.\nOUTCOMES AND RESULTS: There were no significant differences between treatment and observation groups on the CPIB pre-treatment, but there were significant differences post-treatment. The differences appeared to be largely due to significant gains in the treatment group. No participants reached their ideal CPIB target, and few reached their satisfactory target. Static CPIB short form and CAT scores were not significantly different, with an average of five CAT items administered per participant. Overall group similarities between patient and proxy scores may have obscured wide variability across individual patient-proxy pairs. Associations between CPIB and VHI-10, health-related quality of life, self-reported speech severity, and depression ranged from weak to moderate.\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The CPIB appears to be sensitive to capturing change with intervention, and similar results are obtained with the static short form and CAT formats. One clinical caution is that even with gains observed in the treatment group, no participants obtained their ideal communicative participation goals, and few obtained a satisfactory level of communicative participation. Thus, while current interventions are beneficial, they may not meet the full range of clients' communication needs. While responding to the CPIB through a proxy rater may be feasible, caution is warranted due to concerns about maintaining the autonomy of PwPD.\nWHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject The communication disorders associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) can have a negative impact on quality of life and life participation as measured by patient (or person)-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB) is one PROM available to use with adults with communication disorders. However, little is known about whether the CPIB captures changes in communicative participation as a result of standard care treatment for people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Use of computerised adaptive testing (CAT), proxy report and comparison to targeted participation outcomes have not been explored. What this study adds to existing knowledge As a result of this study, we know that the CPIB captured differences between treatment and observation groups after community-based, standard care speech therapy intervention focusing on motor speech production in PwPD. Static short form and CAT scores did not differ significantly, so the CAT option provides better efficiency requiring, on average, five items to administer compared to the 10-item short form. Proxy and PwPD scores did not differ as a group, but wide variability was noted. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The CPIB may be a clinically sensitive instrument for capturing changes in communicative participation after treatment. No participants met their ideal CPIB target, and few reached their satisfactory target, suggesting that while current interventions contribute to gains in communicative participation, there are still unmet needs that may call for support and interventions addressing the more complex array of factors affecting communicative participation outcomes for PwPD.", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\":

EcoActive is a collection of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages (or phages) are viruses that infect only bacteria. The phages in EcoActive infect a specific type of bacteria called Adherent Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC).\n\nThe cause of Crohn's disease is poorly understood. However, the presence of AIEC in the intestines is associated with worsening inflammation in this disease. Inflammation is the presence of redness, irritation, and ulcers in the intestines. By using phages that only infect and kill this specific type of bacteria (AIEC), it is the hope this can be used to improve the course of Crohn's disease. The phages would only target the AIEC, without affecting the natural, often helpful, bacteria of the intestines. EcoActive may also lessen the use of antibiotics to control symptoms. When antibiotics are used, they can have major effects on the rest of the bacteria in the intestines. Also, repeated use can cause intestinal bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.

Symptoms such as refusal to cooperate, impaired communication and cognition, and agitation and anxiety can play a large part in the difficulties that surround caring for an AD patient. There are medications that are marketed to treat AD symptoms, but many have harmful side effects. Holistic methods, such as music therapy, are gaining attention for their ease of implementation and limited side effects. Aim: The purpose of this project was to implement a music therapy intervention for people with AD in hospice and evaluate the levels of agitation experienced by the patient. Method: The study was conducted over a period of eight weeks. Music therapy was administered nightly for 20 minutes by caregivers and the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale was completed at the beginning of the study, at four weeks into the study, and at the completion of the study. Results: The intervention was found to be significant in reducing aberrant vocalization, motor agitation, aggressiveness, and resisting care. Conclusion: Based on the findings, music therapy may be useful as a holistic intervention for decreasing agitation in individuals with AD.", "gold_text": "{\"entities\": [{\"id\": 0, \"text\":
